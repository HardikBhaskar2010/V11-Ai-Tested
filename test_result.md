    message: "üîç TESTING COMPLETED - CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED: The AI idea generation feature has a critical bug in response parsing or React state management. Component selection works perfectly, OpenRouter API calls succeed (200 status), but generated ideas never appear in the UI. The issue is NOT with localStorage, component persistence, or API connectivity. The problem occurs after successful API response - likely in JSON parsing or React component state updates. Main agent needs to debug the OpenRouter response handling and React state management in AIIdeaGeneration.js."
